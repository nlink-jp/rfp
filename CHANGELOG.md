## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Initial release as a standalone repository, split out of
  [skills-series](https://github.com/nlink-jp/skills-series) per
  [ADR-004](https://github.com/nlink-jp/.github/blob/main/adr/004-skills-series-umbrella.md).
  The skill itself is unchanged from skills-series v0.3.1; earlier history
  lives in that repository.
- `make package` — builds `dist/rfp-vX.Y.Z.zip` with the skill folder at the
  zip root, ready to attach to a GitHub Release, unzip into
  `~/.claude/skills/`, or upload to claude.ai (Settings → Skills).
